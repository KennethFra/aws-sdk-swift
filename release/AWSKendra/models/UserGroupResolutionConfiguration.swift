This is useful for setting up user context filtering, where Amazon Kendra filters search results for different users based on their group's access to documents. You can also map your users to their groups for user context filtering using the [PutPrincipalMapping operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_PutPrincipalMapping.html). To set up an Amazon Web Services SSO identity source in the console to use with Amazon Kendra, see [Getting started with an Amazon Web Services SSO identity source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/getting-started-aws-sso.html). You must also grant the required permissions to use Amazon Web Services SSO with Amazon Kendra. For more information, see [IAM roles for Amazon Web Services SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-aws-sso).
