The integration response data that can be mapped include an integration response header expressed in integration.response.header.{name}, a static value enclosed within a pair of single quotes (e.g., 'application/json'), or a JSON expression from the back-end response payload in the form of integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}, where JSON-expression is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.)
