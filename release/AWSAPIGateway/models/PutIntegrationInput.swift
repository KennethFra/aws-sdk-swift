For a private HTTP integration, the URI is not used for routing.
    ///
    /// * For AWS or AWS_PROXY integrations, the URI is of the form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|action/{service_api}. Here, {Region} is the API Gateway region (e.g., us-east-1); {service} is the name of the integrated AWS service (e.g., s3); and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain supported by certain AWS service for fast host-name lookup. action can be used for an AWS service action-based API, using an Action={name}&{p1}={v1}&p2={v2}... query string. The ensuing {service_api} refers to a supported action {name} plus any required input parameters. Alternatively, path can be used for an AWS service path-based API. The ensuing service_api refers to the path to an AWS service resource, including the region of the integrated AWS service, if applicable. For example, for integration with the S3 API of [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html), the uri can be either arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetObject&Bucket={bucket}&Key={key} or arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}
