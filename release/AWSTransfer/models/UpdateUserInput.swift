public struct UpdateUserInput: Swift.Equatable {
    /// The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.
    public var homeDirectory: Swift.String?
    /// Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in Target. This value can only be set when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example. [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to '/' and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot. [ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.
    public var homeDirectoryMappings: [TransferClientTypes.HomeDirectoryMapEntry]?
    /// The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.
    public var homeDirectoryType: TransferClientTypes.HomeDirectoryType?
    /// A session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}. This only applies when the domain of ServerId is S3. EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Amazon Web Services Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see [Creating a session policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/session-policy). For more information, see [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service API Reference.

    public var posixProfile: TransferClientTypes.PosixProfile?
    /// Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
