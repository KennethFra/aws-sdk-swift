    /// Represents an object that contains entries and targets for HomeDirectoryMappings. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot. [ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ] If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.
