    /// Use this parameter to increase the storage capacity of an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server or Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Specifies the storage capacity target value, in GiB, to increase the storage capacity for the file system that you're updating. You can't make a storage capacity increase request if there is an existing storage capacity increase request in progress. For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. To increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16 MBps of throughput capacity. For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target value can be the following:
    ///
    /// * For SCRATCH_2 and PERSISTENT_1 SSD deployment types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must be greater than the current storage capacity.
    ///
    /// * For PERSISTENT HDD file systems, valid values are multiples of 6000 GiB for 12-MBps throughput per TiB file systems and multiples of 1800 GiB for 40-MBps throughput per TiB file systems. The values must be greater than the current storage capacity.
    ///
    /// * For SCRATCH_1 file systems, you can't increase the storage capacity.
    ///
    ///
    /// For OpenZFS file systems, the input/output operations per second (IOPS) automatically scale with increases to the storage capacity if IOPS is configured for automatic scaling. If the storage capacity increase would result in less than 3 IOPS per GiB of storage, this operation returns an error.
