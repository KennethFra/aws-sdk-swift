        /// The action to take when the cluster step fails. Possible values are TERMINATE_CLUSTER, CANCEL_AND_WAIT, and CONTINUE. TERMINATE_JOB_FLOW is provided for backward compatibility. We recommend using TERMINATE_CLUSTER instead. If a cluster's StepConcurrencyLevel is greater than 1, do not use AddJobFlowSteps to submit a step with this parameter set to CANCEL_AND_WAIT or TERMINATE_CLUSTER. The step is not submitted and the action fails with a message that the ActionOnFailure setting is not valid. If you change a cluster's StepConcurrencyLevel to be greater than 1 while a step is running, the ActionOnFailure parameter may not behave as you expect. In this case, for a step that fails with this parameter set to CANCEL_AND_WAIT, pending steps and the running step are not canceled; for a step that fails with this parameter set to TERMINATE_CLUSTER, the cluster does not terminate.
