    /// A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the RespondToAuthChallenge API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: post authentication, pre token generation, define auth challenge, create auth challenge, and verify auth challenge. When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your RespondToAuthChallenge request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. For more information, see [Customizing User Pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. Take the following limitations into consideration when you use the ClientMetadata parameter:
    ///
    /// * Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration does not include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.
    ///
    /// * Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.
    ///
    /// * Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value, so don't use it to provide sensitive information.
    public var clientMetadata: [Swift.String:Swift.String]?
    /// The session which should be passed both ways in challenge-response calls to the service. If InitiateAuth or RespondToAuthChallenge API call determines that the caller needs to go through another challenge, they return a session with other challenge parameters. This session should be passed as it is to the next RespondToAuthChallenge API call.
    public var session: Swift.String?
    /// Contextual data such as the user's device fingerprint, IP address, or location used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.
