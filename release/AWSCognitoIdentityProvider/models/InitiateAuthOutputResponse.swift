    ///
    /// * SMS_MFA: Next challenge is to supply an SMS_MFA_CODE, delivered via SMS.
    ///
    /// * PASSWORD_VERIFIER: Next challenge is to supply PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE, PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK, and TIMESTAMP after the client-side SRP calculations.
    ///
    /// * CUSTOM_CHALLENGE: This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued.
    ///
    /// * DEVICE_SRP_AUTH: If device tracking was enabled on your user pool and the previous challenges were passed, this challenge is returned so that Amazon Cognito can start tracking this device.
    ///
    /// * DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER: Similar to PASSWORD_VERIFIER, but for devices only.
    ///
    /// * NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED: For users who are required to change their passwords after successful first login. This challenge should be passed with NEW_PASSWORD and any other required attributes.
    ///
    /// * MFA_SETUP: For users who are required to setup an MFA factor before they can sign-in. The MFA types enabled for the user pool will be listed in the challenge parameters MFA_CAN_SETUP value. To setup software token MFA, use the session returned here from InitiateAuth as an input to AssociateSoftwareToken, and use the session returned by VerifySoftwareToken as an input to RespondToAuthChallenge with challenge name MFA_SETUP to complete sign-in. To setup SMS MFA, users will need help from an administrator to add a phone number to their account and then call InitiateAuth again to restart sign-in.
